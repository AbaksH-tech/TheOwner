# TheOwner
A unique utility for protecting specific unique users


The essence of the plugin: It allows you to select players who will be protected and untouchable. These players cannot be banned, kicked, killed, subjected to various commands, or teleported. In simple terms, complete protection.

The configuration is complete and easy to use. The configuration file contains a list of options that allow you to choose what to enable and disable. For example, you can disable damage from mobs, so mobs won't be able to attack, but players will still be able to deal damage. You can also disable everything so that no one can inflict damage.

It can be used as protection against commands on vanilla and other servers, for example, as a regular player.  As a player under cover, administrators won't be able to ban you, but you'll be treated like a normal player, meaning others can attack you, etc.

Commands: No-commands (All settings are in the config file.)

Permissions:

psh.bypass - To select a group of individuals (administrators) who will be able to ban such players, and who will have full access to these players.
